Deciding what to cook can be a pain. Our solution is creating ChefGPT, a CRUD application that generates a recipe based on your selected ingredients. You can easily drag and drop ingredients from your fridge to your bowl. By querying recipes titles from Spoonacular API and recipe instructions from OpenAI (ChatGPT), you can have personalized recipes at your fingertips!

CHEFGPT v1 integrates technology stack from React, Express, MongoDB, Google Oauth, and Webpack.
Current features include:

1. User login with Oauth
2. Ability to drag and drop ingredients and render a personalized recipe based on HTTP/API requests
3. Ability to add and delete ingredients to the fridge
